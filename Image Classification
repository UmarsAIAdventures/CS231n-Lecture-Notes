Semantic gap - Label and Pixel Numbers
Algorithm must be able to discen, different lightings, inrercalss variations, background clutter etc 
Rather tha hardwired rules, data driver approach
1. Coillect a dataset 2. USe machine learning to Train 3. Predict the label
Example dataset: CIFAR 10 data set
Nearest neighbor algorithm
L1 Manhattan distance  to compare images
